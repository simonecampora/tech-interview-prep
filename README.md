# The Tech Interview Prep Material

## Introduction
Any of you that went thru technical interviews (Software Engineers, Technical Managers) knows that it is not just about showing what you know. How to recognize problem solving patterns, code on a white-board and solve complex system design problems in an hour is a set of very specific skills that must be practiced.

This is a collection of materials and personal tips that will help you go "one step deeper" into answering coding problems and system design questions, using what I believe is the best way to learn these skills: practice :)

## The Coding interview
This is a list of sample problems that are very similar to the ones asked in coding screens and coding interviews. Difficulty and problem may vary, but the concepts and problem-solving skills may be quite similar! This is a work in progress, for more exmaples rely on online latforms as recommended in the "Useful Links" section.

### Arrays and strings
* [Unique](coding-problems/arrays-strings/UniqueString.java)
* [Palindrome Permutation](coding-problems/arrays-strings/PalindromePermutation.java)
* [URLify](coding-problems/arrays-strings/URLify.java)
* [CountIslands](coding-problems/arrays-strings/CountIslands.java)
* [OneAway](coding-problems/arrays-strings/OneAway.java)

### Linked lists
* TODO

### Stacks and queues
* TODO

### Trees and graphs
* TODO

### Recursion and dynamic programming
* [Fibonacci](coding-problems/recursion/Fibo.java)

### Bit manipulation
* TODO

### Search problems
* TODO

### Useful resources
* **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)**: plenty of problems with solutions, online. Lots of resoruces and Q&A Forum to get unstuck. Highly recommended.
* **[Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/)**: Subscribe to the weekly practice problems to keep practicing even if you are not interviewing actively.
* **[InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)**: Simple and gradual set of coding problems explained in details.

## System designs

### Basic concepts
* [Consistent Hashing](notes/system-design/Consistent-Hashing.md)
* Load Balancing
* Scalability (+ Cap Theorem)
* Caching
* Storage
* Data Partitioning
* Indexing
* SQL and NoSQL

### Design problems
This is a list of the most common problems:
* How to design TinyURL
* How to design Instagram
* How to design Pastebin
* How to design Dropbox
* How to design Online Chat
* How to design Twitter
* How to design Netflix
* How to design Uber

### Useful resources
* **[Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/collection/page/5668639101419520/5649050225344512/5766466041282560/preview)**: paid course summarizing the basics of system designs from theory brush-up to examples.
* **[Design Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/)

## Tech Interview Resources
This is a list of other directories or useful resources while preparing for tech interviews
* **[Awesome Scalability](https://github.com/binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability)**: Great collection of articles and deep-dives per topic around scalability.
* **[Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/)**: Free peer-to-peer platform to practice in-person interviews of any type. Great to get used to interviews.
