# The Tech Interview Prep Material

## Introduction
Any of you that went thru technical interviews (Software Engineers, Technical Managers) knows that it is not just about showing what you know. How to recognize problem solving patterns, code on a white-board and solve complex system design problems in an hour is a set of very specific skills that must be practiced.

This is a collection of materials and personal tips that will help you go "one step deeper" into answering coding problems and system design questions, using what I believe is the best way to learn these skills: practice :)

## The Coding interview

### Coding problems

#### Arrays and strings
* [Unique](coding-problems/arrays-strings/UniqueString.java)
* [Palindrome Permutation](coding-problems/arrays-strings/PalindromePermutation.java)
* [URLify](coding-problems/arrays-strings/URLify.java)
* [CountIslands](coding-problems/arrays-strings/CountIslands.java)

#### Linked lists
* TODO

#### Stacks and queues
* TODO

#### Trees and graphs
* TODO

#### Recursion and dynamic programming
* [Fibonacci](coding-problems/recursion/Fibo.java)

#### Bit manipulation
* TODO

#### Search problems
* TODO

### Useful resources
* **[Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/)**: Subscribe to the weekly practice problems to keep practicing even if you are not interviewing actively.
* **[InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)**: Simple and gradual set of coding problems explained in details.

## System designs

### Design problems
* TODO

### Useful resources
* **[Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/collection/page/5668639101419520/5649050225344512/5766466041282560/preview)**: paid course summarizing the basics of system designs from theory brush-up to examples.
