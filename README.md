# The Tech Interview Prep Material

## Introduction
Any of you that went thru technical interviews (Software Engineers, Technical Managers) knows that it is not just about showing what you know. How to recognize problem solving patterns, code on a white-board and solve complex system design problems in an hour is a set of very specific skills that must be practiced.

This is a collection of materials and personal tips that will help you go "one step deeper" into answering coding problems and system design questions, using what I believe is the best way to learn these skills: practice :)

## The Coding interview
