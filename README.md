# The Tech Interview Prep Material

## What is this?
This is a collection of links and materials useful to prepare technical interviews (Software engineers, Tech Management). It's kept up to date with more links, repositories and literature that can help prepare for interviewing for Tech roles.

Preparing for technical interviews is a mix of 1) Coding practice, 2) System Design, 3) Behavioral questions. Most of tech companies have a variation of interview styles for all of those but preparing for interviews is a skill per-se. In this list I grouped what I believe be the most exahustive list of material to prepare for those interviews. Not all is needed, but everyone has a different approach for preparing interviews and I hope this variety will help find what works best for everyone.
